# The Significance of Union and Intersection Types in TypeScript

TypeScript's strong typing system offers powerful features like Union and Intersection types, which enhance code flexibility and safety. Understanding these types is crucial for writing robust and maintainable code.

## Union Types

**Union Types** allow a variable to hold multiple types. Defined using the `|` symbol, Union types enable a variable to accept different types, offering flexibility while ensuring type safety. For example:

```typescript
function printValue(value: string | number):void {
  console.log(value);
}
printValue("Hello");
printValue(42);

In this example, the printValue function can accept both strings and numbers.



Intersection Types, defined using the & symbol, combine multiple types into one. This ensures that a variable or object must have all the properties from the combined types. For example:

interface Person {
  name: string;
}

interface Employee {
  role: string;
}

type EmployeeDetails = Person & Employee;

const employee: EmployeeDetails = { name: "Alice", role: "Developer" };

Here, the EmployeeDetails type combines Person and Employee into a single type, ensuring the object has both name and role.

By mastering Union and Intersection types, developers can write flexible, type-safe code that is easier to maintain and less error-prone.
